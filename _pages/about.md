**Zheng Lab** is a one-person Knowledge Ecosystem Builder (KEB) initiative that integrates research, theory-building, content creation, and applied insight into a unified intellectual environment. As a KEB, Zheng Lab does not operate as a traditional lab or academic unit; instead, it designs and grows a self-sustaining knowledge ecosystem—combining network science, economics, complexity theory, and AI—to generate new conceptual frameworks, cultivate interdisciplinary connections, and translate structural insights into accessible narratives and practical tools. Through continuous theory development, multi-format knowledge production, and an expanding collaboration network, Zheng Lab functions as a living ecosystem where ideas, methods, and applications co-evolve, enabling a new model of independent scholarship and intellectual entrepreneurship.
