**Zheng Lab** is a personal research lab led by Ethan Zheng. We explore:

- Theoretical econometrics with a focus on identification and inference,
- **Network science** (spectral methods, isoperimetric ideas, causal structure on graphs),
- **Sports analytics**, especially football passing networks and tactical inference.

**Mission.** Link rigorous theory to real-world decisions â€” *from proofs to practice.*

**Contact.** Prefer GitHub issues or LinkedIn for collaboration inquiries.
